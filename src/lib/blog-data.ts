const fatFreezingContent = `## What is Fat Freezing?

Fat freezing, scientifically known as cryolipolysis, is a non-invasive body contouring treatment that uses controlled cooling to eliminate stubborn fat cells. Unlike traditional weight loss methods, fat freezing specifically targets and destroys fat cells in problem areas.

## Fat Freezing Prices in South Africa

The cost of fat freezing varies significantly across South Africa:

- Johannesburg CBD: R1,500 - R3,000
- Sandton: R2,000 - R4,000
- Pretoria: R1,200 - R2,500
- Galeo Beauty (Hartbeespoort): [R799.20](/prices/fat-freezing/cryolipolysis-fat-freezing)
- Cape Town: R1,800 - R3,500

### Why Our Price is Lower

At Galeo Beauty, we believe premium treatments shouldn't come with premium prices. Our R799.20 per session pricing is possible because of lower overhead costs, direct relationships with equipment suppliers, and no franchise fees.

## What Does Fat Freezing Treat?

Fat freezing is effective for:

- Double chin - One of the most popular treatment areas
- Love handles - Stubborn side fat
- Belly fat - Upper and lower abdomen
- Bra fat - Back fat around the bra line
- Inner thighs - Reduce thigh circumference
- Upper arms - Tighten "bingo wings"

## How Fat Freezing Works

1. Consultation: We assess your problem areas and create a treatment plan
2. Application: A gel pad protects your skin while the applicator is placed
3. Cooling: The area is cooled to -10°C to -13°C for 30-60 minutes
4. Massage: Post-treatment massage helps break down the frozen fat cells
5. Results: Fat cells die naturally and are eliminated over 2-3 months

## Results You Can Expect

- 20-25% fat reduction in treated area per session
- Results visible after 4-6 weeks
- Full results at 12 weeks
- Permanent - fat cells don't regenerate

## Is Fat Freezing Safe?

Yes! Fat freezing is FDA-cleared and CE-approved. At Galeo Beauty, we use only certified equipment. Side effects are minimal and temporary: redness, numbness, and mild tingling.

## Book Your Fat Freezing Session

Ready to freeze away stubborn fat? At R799.20 per session, Galeo Beauty offers the best value for fat freezing near Pretoria.

const lashExtensionsContent = `## Transform Your Look with [Lash Extensions](/prices/lashes/classic-lashes)

Lash extensions have become one of the most popular beauty treatments in South Africa. At Galeo Beauty in Hartbeespoort, we offer a full range of lash services to enhance your natural beauty. Unlike strip lashes, these are semi-permanent fibers that are attached individually to your natural lashes for a longer, thicker, and darker lash line.

## Understanding Your Lash Options

### Classic Lashes: The Natural Enhancement
Classic lashes are the original style where one extension is applied to one natural lash. This 1:1 ratio creates a natural, mascara-like effect without the clumps. It's the perfect choice if you have a good amount of natural lashes but want to add length and consistent curl.

**Best for:**
- Everyday wear (work/school)
- Clients who want a subtle enhancement
- First-time lash clients who are nervous about looking "too done"

*Our Classic sets start from R630.*

### Volume Lashes: Drama and Fluffiness
Volume lashes involve applying a handmade fan of 2-5 very fine extensions to a single natural lash. This creates a fluffy, fuller look that can fill in gaps if you have sparse natural lashes. While it sounds heavy, volume fans are actually lighter than a single classic extension!

**Best for:**
- Special occasions and weddings
- Clients with sparse natural lashes (fans cover the gaps)
- Those who love a glamorous, strip-lash look

*Our Volume sets start from R720.*

### Hybrid Lashes: The Perfect Balance
Can't decide? Hybrid lashes combine the best of both worlds. We mix Classic (single extensions) and Volume (fans) to create a textured, wispy look that has both definition and fluffiness. This is often the most requested style as it offers a "Kim K" style texture.

**Best for:**
- A textured, messy-bun aesthetic
- Clients who find Classic too simple but Volume too dramatic
- Adding density without going full glam

*Our Hybrid sets start from R720.*

### Glamour Lashes: Measured Maximum Volume
For those who want maximum impact, our Glamour sets use advanced mega-volume techniques to create a dense, dark lash line. This is a show-stopping look for events, photoshoots, or anyone who loves a bold aesthetic.

*Glamour sets start from R900.*

## How to Choose the Right Style

Choosing the right lash style depends on your eye shape and lifestyle:

- **Almond Eyes**: Any style works! Cat-eye styling (longer at the ends) looks particularly stunning.
- **Hooded Eyes**: Open-eye styling (longer in the middle) helps open up the eye area.
- **Round Eyes**: Cat-eye styling helps elongate the eye for a sultry look.

During your appointment at Galeo Beauty, our technicians will assess your natural lashes and recommend the style that will frame your face perfectly while maintaining the health of your natural lashes.

## Lash Treatments (No Extensions)

If you're not ready for extensions, we also offer natural lash enhancements:

- **Lash Lift**: Essentially a perm for your lashes, creating a lift and curl that lasts 6-8 weeks.
- **Lash Tint**: Dyeing the lashes black to create definition without mascara.
- **Lash Lamination**: A nourishing treatment that lifts, tints, and conditions lashes for a glossy finish.

## Lash Extension Aftercare

To get the most out of your new lashes:

1. Avoid water for 24-48 hours after application to let the glue cure.
2. Don't use oil-based products around the eyes (oil dissolves the bond).
3. Sleep on your back to prevent crushing them on your pillow.
4. Brush daily with a clean spoolie to keep them neat.
5. Book fills every 2-3 weeks to maintain fullness.

## Why Choose Galeo Beauty for Lashes?

- **Certified Technicians**: All our lash artists are professionally trained and certified.
- **Quality Products**: We use premium adhesives and high-quality synthetic mink lashes that feel soft and natural.
- **Hygienic Practice**: We use individual tools sanitized between each client.

// New Article: Acne Treatment
const acneTreatmentContent = `## Understanding Acne: Causes and Professional Solutions

Acne affects millions of South Africans, from teenagers to adults. At Galeo Beauty, we offer professional treatments that target acne at its source, helping you achieve clearer, healthier skin.

## What Causes Acne?

Acne develops when:
- Excess oil (sebum) clogs pores
- Dead skin cells accumulate

- Hormonal changes trigger oil production

Contributing factors include stress, diet, hormonal imbalances, genetics, and using the wrong skincare products.

## Professional Acne Treatments at Galeo Beauty

### 1. [Dermalogica Pro Skin Treatment](/prices/dermalogica/pro-skin) (R950)

Our signature facial includes deep cleansing, extraction, and customized treatment for acne-prone skin. The Face Mapping analysis identifies problem zones.

### 2. [Pro Power Peel](/prices/dermalogica/pro-power-peel) (R1,100)

Chemical peels are highly effective for acne. They exfoliate dead skin, unclog pores, reduce bacteria, fade acne scars, and improve skin texture.

### 3. [Microneedling](/prices/medical/microneedling) (R1,620)

Microneedling stimulates collagen production and is excellent for treating acne scars, reducing active breakouts, improving skin texture, and minimizing pore size.

### 4. LED Light Therapy

Blue light therapy kills acne-causing bacteria, while red light reduces inflammation. Ask about adding LED to any facial treatment.

## Acne Treatment Timeline

- Week 1-2: Initial consultation and first treatment
- Week 4-6: Follow-up treatment, noticeable improvement
- Week 8-12: Significant clearing, maintenance phase
- Ongoing: Monthly maintenance treatments recommended

## Home Care Between Treatments

// New Article: IPL Hair Removal
const iplHairRemovalContent = `## [IPL Hair Removal](/prices/ipl/ladies-full-face): Your Complete Guide

Tired of shaving, waxing, and plucking? IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) hair removal offers a permanent solution to unwanted hair. At Galeo Beauty, we use CE-approved IPL equipment for safe, effective treatments.

## What is IPL Hair Removal?

IPL uses broad-spectrum light to target the melanin (pigment) in hair follicles. The light converts to heat, damaging the follicle and preventing future hair growth.

## IPL vs Laser: What's the Difference?

IPL uses broad-spectrum light and treats larger areas. Laser uses a single wavelength. Both are effective for permanent hair reduction.

## Treatment Areas and Prices

### Ladies IPL
- Upper Lip: R270
- Chin: R270
- Underarms: R360
- Brazilian: R540
- Hollywood: R630
- Full Legs: R990
- Full Arms: R630

### Gents IPL
- Back: R900
- Chest: R720
- Shoulders: R540
- Full Beard Shaping: R450

## How Many Sessions Do I Need?

Most clients need 6-8 sessions for optimal results. Why? Hair grows in cycles. IPL only works on hair in the active growth phase. Multiple sessions catch all hairs.

Typical schedule:
- Sessions 1-3: Every 4 weeks
- Sessions 4-6: Every 6 weeks
- Sessions 7-8: Every 8 weeks
- Maintenance: 1-2 times per year

## What to Expect

Before treatment:
- Shave the area 24 hours before
- Avoid sun exposure for 2 weeks
- No waxing or plucking for 4 weeks

During treatment:
- Feels like a rubber band snap
- Sessions take 15-60 minutes depending on area
- No downtime required

After treatment:
- Mild redness for a few hours
- Hair sheds over 1-2 weeks
- Avoid sun exposure

## Am I a Good Candidate?

IPL works best on:
- Light to medium skin tones
- Dark hair (blonde, red, grey hair doesn't respond well)
- Healthy skin without active infections

const antiAgingContent = `## Best Anti-Aging Treatments in 2026: What Actually Works

Confused by all the anti-aging options? From facials to injectables, we break down what actually works and what's worth your money.

## Understanding Skin Aging

Skin ages due to:
- Collagen breakdown (starts in your 20s!)
- Sun damage (the #1 cause of premature aging)
- Loss of elasticity
- Reduced cell turnover
- Decreased hydration

## Professional Anti-Aging Treatments

Injectable hyaluronic acid restores volume to cheeks, lips, and nasolabial folds. Results last 6-18 months.

Best for: Volume loss, deep wrinkles, lip enhancement

## When to Start Anti-Aging Treatments

- 20s: Prevention - sunscreen, antioxidants, good skincare
- 30s: Early intervention - professional facials, retinol
- 40s: Active treatment - peels, microneedling, light fillers
- 50+: Maintenance and restoration - combination approach

## The Best Anti-Aging Investment

If you can only do one thing: wear SPF 50 every single day. Sun damage causes 90% of visible aging.

// New Article: Lip Fillers Guide
const lipFillersContent = `## Lip Fillers in South Africa: Everything You Need to Know

Considering lip fillers? This comprehensive guide covers costs, what to expect, and how to choose the right provider.

## What Are Lip Fillers?

Lip fillers are injectable treatments using hyaluronic acid (HA) to add volume, shape, and definition to your lips. HA is a substance naturally found in your body, making it safe and well-tolerated.

## Lip Filler Prices at Galeo Beauty

- [Dermal Lip Fillers](/prices/hart-aesthetics/fillers-lips) (1ml): R2,800
- [Russian Lip Technique](/prices/hart-aesthetics/russian-lips) (1ml): R3,000

## Types of Lip Filler Techniques

### Classic Lip Fillers
Adds volume throughout the lip for a fuller, natural enhancement. Best for those wanting subtle to moderate volume increase.

### Russian Lip Technique
Creates a flatter, more defined lip shape with a heart-shaped cupid's bow. The filler is injected vertically, creating lift rather than projection. Best for those wanting defined lips without the "duck lip" look.

## How Much Filler Do I Need?

- First time / Subtle: 0.5ml
- Natural enhancement: 1ml (most common)
- Fuller look: 1.5-2ml (may be done in stages)

We recommend starting with 1ml and adding more later if desired.

## What to Expect

### Before Treatment
- Avoid blood thinners (aspirin, fish oil) for 1 week
- No alcohol 24 hours before
- Come with clean lips, no makeup

### During Treatment
- Numbing cream applied for comfort
- Treatment takes 15-30 minutes
- You'll see results immediately

### After Treatment
- Swelling peaks at 24-48 hours
- Bruising possible for 1-2 weeks
- Final results visible at 2 weeks
- Results last 6-12 months

## Risks and Side Effects

Common (temporary):
- Swelling
- Bruising
- Tenderness

Rare:
- Asymmetry (correctable)
- Lumps (usually massage-able)
- Infection (very rare with proper technique)

## How to Choose a Provider

Look for:
- Qualified, trained practitioner
- Before and after photos
- Quality products (we use premium HA fillers)
- Clean, professional environment
- Honest consultation

Avoid:
- Extremely cheap prices
- No consultation offered
- Pressure to buy more

Can't decide between waxing and IPL hair removal?

Waxing: Immediate results, no commitment, works on all hair colors, affordable per session. Regrowth in 3-6 weeks.

IPL: Permanent reduction, requires multiple sessions, works best on dark hair, higher initial investment. Results are permanent.

Many clients do both - IPL for permanent reduction, waxing for maintenance.

const skincareRoutineContent = `## Building the Perfect Skincare Routine: A South African Guide

Not sure where to start with skincare? This guide helps you build an effective routine using professional advice from our Dermalogica-trained therapists.

## The Basic Routine: 3 Steps

Every skincare routine needs these fundamentals:

### 1. Cleanse
Remove makeup, dirt, and excess oil. Double cleanse at night (oil cleanser + water-based cleanser).

### 2. Moisturize
Hydrate and protect your skin barrier. Even oily skin needs moisturizer!

### 3. SPF (Morning Only)
Non-negotiable. SPF 30-50 every single day, even when cloudy.

## The Complete Routine: 6 Steps

For optimal results, add:

### Morning
1. Cleanser
2. Toner/Essence
3. Serum (Vitamin C recommended)
4. Eye Cream
5. Moisturizer
6. SPF 50

### Evening
1. Oil Cleanser (to remove makeup/SPF)
2. Water-Based Cleanser
3. Toner/Essence
4. Treatment Serum (Retinol, AHA/BHA)
5. Eye Cream
6. Night Moisturizer/Oil

## Ingredients That Actually Work

### Vitamin C
Brightens, protects from sun damage, boosts collagen.
Best for: Dull skin, hyperpigmentation, anti-aging

### Retinol
The gold standard for anti-aging. Increases cell turnover, reduces wrinkles.
Best for: Aging skin, acne, texture issues
Start slowly - 2-3 times per week

### Niacinamide
Reduces pores, controls oil, strengthens skin barrier.
Best for: Oily skin, enlarged pores, redness

### Hyaluronic Acid
Intense hydration, plumps skin.
Best for: All skin types, dehydration

### Salicylic Acid (BHA)
Unclogs pores, reduces breakouts.
Best for: Acne-prone, oily skin

## Common Skincare Mistakes

1. Over-exfoliating (1-2 times per week is enough)
2. Skipping SPF (the biggest mistake!)
3. Using too many actives at once
4. Not giving products time to work (8-12 weeks)
5. Picking at your skin
6. Sleeping in makeup

## Professional Treatments to Boost Your Routine

Home care can only do so much. Monthly professional treatments enhance results:

- Dermalogica Pro Skin (R950): Deep cleanse and customized treatment
- Pro Power Peel (R1,100): Professional-grade exfoliation
- Microneedling (R1,620): Boosts product absorption

const microbladingContent = `## The Ultimate Guide to Semi-Permanent Brows

Tired of drawing on your eyebrows every morning? Semi-permanent brow treatments can give you perfect brows that last 1-3 years. But which technique is right for you?

At Galeo Beauty, we offer both microblading and powder brows, and we'll help you decide which suits your skin type, lifestyle, and desired look.

## What is Microblading?

Microblading is a semi-permanent tattooing technique that creates hair-like strokes to mimic natural brow hairs.

### How It Works
- A handheld tool with tiny needles creates fine incisions
- Pigment is deposited into the superficial layer of skin
- Creates realistic, individual hair strokes

### Best For
- Natural, subtle enhancement
- Normal to dry skin
- Sparse or thin brows
- Those who want a "no makeup" look

At Galeo Beauty: R1,350

## What are Powder Brows?

Powder brows (also called ombre brows) create a soft, filled-in look similar to makeup.

### How It Works
- A machine deposits tiny dots of pigment
- Creates a gradient effect (lighter at front, darker at tail)
- Results in a "powdered" makeup appearance

### Best For
- Fuller, more defined look
- Oily or combination skin
- Those who fill in their brows daily
- Clients wanting longer-lasting results

At Galeo Beauty: R1,710

## Side-by-Side Comparison

Microblading:
- Look: Natural, hair-like
- Duration: 12-18 months
- Best skin type: Dry to normal
- Price at Galeo: R1,350

Powder Brows:
- Look: Soft, makeup finish
- Duration: 2-3 years
- Best skin type: Oily to combination
- Price at Galeo: R1,710

## Hybrid Brows: The Best of Both

Hybrid brows combine microblading strokes at the front with powder shading at the tail. This creates a natural-looking front with a defined, fuller tail.

At Galeo Beauty: R1,710

## The Treatment Process

1. Consultation: We discuss your desired shape, color, and technique
2. Brow Mapping: We measure and draw your perfect brow shape
3. Numbing: Topical anesthetic is applied for comfort
4. Treatment: The procedure takes 1.5-2 hours
5. Healing: Initial darkness fades by 30-40% as brows heal
6. Touch-Up: A follow-up appointment 4-6 weeks later perfects the result

## Healing and Aftercare

Days 1-3: Brows appear dark and bold
Days 4-7: Scabbing begins
Days 7-14: Scabs fall off, brows appear light
Days 14-30: Color returns as skin heals

Aftercare Tips:
- Keep dry for 7 days
- Avoid sweating and swimming
- Don't pick or scratch
- Apply aftercare balm as directed

## Alternatives to Consider

### Brow Lamination (R423)

If you're not ready for semi-permanent makeup, brow lamination redirects brow hairs upward, creates a fuller fluffy look, lasts 6-8 weeks, and involves no needles.

### Brow Henna (R423)

Tints both skin and hair for a filled-in look that lasts 2-4 weeks.
