const fatFreezingContent = `## What is Fat Freezing?

Fat freezing, scientifically known as cryolipolysis, is a non-invasive body contouring treatment that uses controlled cooling to eliminate stubborn fat cells. Unlike traditional weight loss methods, fat freezing specifically targets and destroys fat cells in problem areas.

## Fat Freezing Prices in South Africa

The cost of fat freezing varies significantly across South Africa:

- Johannesburg CBD: R1,500 - R3,000
- Sandton: R2,000 - R4,000
- Pretoria: R1,200 - R2,500
- Galeo Beauty (Hartbeespoort): R799.20
- Cape Town: R1,800 - R3,500

### Why Our Price is Lower

At Galeo Beauty, we believe premium treatments shouldn't come with premium prices. Our R799.20 per session pricing is possible because of lower overhead costs, direct relationships with equipment suppliers, and no franchise fees.

## What Does Fat Freezing Treat?

Fat freezing is effective for:

- Double chin - One of the most popular treatment areas
- Love handles - Stubborn side fat
- Belly fat - Upper and lower abdomen
- Bra fat - Back fat around the bra line
- Inner thighs - Reduce thigh circumference
- Upper arms - Tighten "bingo wings"

## How Fat Freezing Works

1. Consultation: We assess your problem areas and create a treatment plan
2. Application: A gel pad protects your skin while the applicator is placed
3. Cooling: The area is cooled to -10°C to -13°C for 30-60 minutes
4. Massage: Post-treatment massage helps break down the frozen fat cells
5. Results: Fat cells die naturally and are eliminated over 2-3 months

## Results You Can Expect

- 20-25% fat reduction in treated area per session
- Results visible after 4-6 weeks
- Full results at 12 weeks
- Permanent - fat cells don't regenerate

## Is Fat Freezing Safe?

Yes! Fat freezing is FDA-cleared and CE-approved. At Galeo Beauty, we use only certified equipment. Side effects are minimal and temporary: redness, numbness, and mild tingling.

const microbladingContent = `## The Ultimate Guide to Semi-Permanent Brows

Tired of drawing on your eyebrows every morning? Semi-permanent brow treatments can give you perfect brows that last 1-3 years. But which technique is right for you?

At Galeo Beauty, we offer both microblading and powder brows, and we'll help you decide which suits your skin type, lifestyle, and desired look.

## What is Microblading?

Microblading is a semi-permanent tattooing technique that creates hair-like strokes to mimic natural brow hairs.

### How It Works
- A handheld tool with tiny needles creates fine incisions
- Pigment is deposited into the superficial layer of skin
- Creates realistic, individual hair strokes

### Best For
- Natural, subtle enhancement
- Normal to dry skin
- Sparse or thin brows
- Those who want a "no makeup" look

At Galeo Beauty: R1,350

## What are Powder Brows?

Powder brows (also called ombre brows) create a soft, filled-in look similar to makeup.

### How It Works
- A machine deposits tiny dots of pigment
- Creates a gradient effect (lighter at front, darker at tail)
- Results in a "powdered" makeup appearance

### Best For
- Fuller, more defined look
- Oily or combination skin
- Those who fill in their brows daily
- Clients wanting longer-lasting results

At Galeo Beauty: R1,710

## Side-by-Side Comparison

Microblading:
- Look: Natural, hair-like
- Duration: 12-18 months
- Best skin type: Dry to normal
- Price at Galeo: R1,350

Powder Brows:
- Look: Soft, makeup finish
- Duration: 2-3 years
- Best skin type: Oily to combination
- Price at Galeo: R1,710

## Hybrid Brows: The Best of Both

Hybrid brows combine microblading strokes at the front with powder shading at the tail. This creates a natural-looking front with a defined, fuller tail.

At Galeo Beauty: R1,710

## The Treatment Process

1. Consultation: We discuss your desired shape, color, and technique
2. Brow Mapping: We measure and draw your perfect brow shape
3. Numbing: Topical anesthetic is applied for comfort
4. Treatment: The procedure takes 1.5-2 hours
5. Healing: Initial darkness fades by 30-40% as brows heal
6. Touch-Up: A follow-up appointment 4-6 weeks later perfects the result

## Healing and Aftercare

Days 1-3: Brows appear dark and bold
Days 4-7: Scabbing begins
Days 7-14: Scabs fall off, brows appear light
Days 14-30: Color returns as skin heals

Aftercare Tips:
- Keep dry for 7 days
- Avoid sweating and swimming
- Don't pick or scratch
- Apply aftercare balm as directed

## Alternatives to Consider

### Brow Lamination (R423)

If you're not ready for semi-permanent makeup, brow lamination redirects brow hairs upward, creates a fuller fluffy look, lasts 6-8 weeks, and involves no needles.

### Brow Henna (R423)

Tints both skin and hair for a filled-in look that lasts 2-4 weeks.
